The Brew Ha Ha API includes an endpoint that allows client applications to retrieve their order from the database. 

In this guide, you'll make a `GET` request to the `/orders/` endpoint to retrieve an order. 

## Before you begin 

Before you make a `GET` request, ensure that you have an access token. For instructions on requesting an access token, see [Request a JSON Web Token](./api#request-a-json-web-token).

## Make a GET request

<Steps>

1. Open a terminal and run the following command:

    <Code code={get_order} lang="shellscript" title="get_order.sh" />

    The API returns a `200 OK` and returns the order with the selected ID:

    <Code code={get_order_response} lang="shellscript" title="get_order_response.sh" />

</Steps>

You can use the data from the `GET` request in your application. For example, you could display the order date, list of products, and order ID to the user.

## What to do next

See [GET /orders/](/api-docs.html#tag/orders/operation/retrieve_orders) for a full list of request parameters and response schemas.
