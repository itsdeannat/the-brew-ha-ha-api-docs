The Brew Ha Ha API includes several endpoints that allow client applications to get a list of supported drinks and snacks. The API also returns JSON data and uses traditional HTTP methods to perform actions on data. Support for other programming languages is in development.

In this guide, you'll register with the API, get a JSON Web Token (JWT) so you can make calls to the API, and then send a test request to the server.

## Before you begin 

To begin using the API, you need to complete two steps:

<Steps>

1. Register with the Brew Ha Ha API
2. Get a JWT to make API requests

</Steps>

### Register with the Brew Ha Ha API

Before you can get a JWT, you need to register with the Brew Ha Ha API. Your username and password can only consist of letters and numbers.

To register with the API:

<Steps>

1. Open a terminal and run the following command:   

   <Code code={register} lang="shellscript" title="register.sh" />

    You'll see the following message after you register with the API:

    <Code code={register_success} lang="shellscript" title="register_success.sh" />

</Steps>

### Request a JSON Web Token

After you register with the API, you need to request a JSON Web Token (JWT) so you can access resources. Without a JWT, you will not be able to make `GET` or `POST` requests to the Brew Ha Ha API. 

To request a JWT:

<Steps>

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

    <Code code={request_jwt} lang="shellscript" title="request_jwt.sh" />

    You'll receive an access token and a refresh token after you send your credentials:

    <Code code={request_jwt_success} lang="shellscript" title="request_jwt_success.sh" />

    <Aside type="caution">
    Be sure to store your access token and refresh token in a secure location.
    </Aside>

</Steps>

### Request a refresh token 

When the access token expires, you can use the refresh token to request a new access token. 

To request a new access token:

<Steps>

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

    <Code code={request_refresh_jwt} lang="shellscript" title="request_refresh_jwt.sh" />

    You'll receive an access token and a refresh token after you send your credentials:

    <Code code={request_refresh_jwt_success} lang="shellscript" title="request_refresh_jwt_success.sh" />

    <Aside type="caution">
    Be sure to store your access token in a secure location.
    </Aside>

</Steps>
