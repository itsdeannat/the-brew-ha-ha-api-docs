The Brew Ha Ha API includes several endpoints that allow client applications to get a list of supported drinks and snacks. The API also returns JSON data and uses traditional HTTP methods to perform actions on data. 

In this guide, you'll authenticate with the API to get a JSON Web Token (JWT) so you can make calls to the API, and then send a test request to the server.

## Before you begin 

To begin using the API, you need to complete two steps:

<Steps>

1. Sign up for the Brew Ha Ha API
2. Get a JSON Web Token (JWT) to make API requests

</Steps>

## Sign up for the Brew Ha Ha API

Before you can get a JWT, you need to sign up for the Brew Ha Ha API. Your username and password can only consist of letters and numbers.

To sign up for the API:

<Steps>

1. Open a terminal and run the following command:   

   <Code code={signup} lang="shellscript" title="signup.sh" />

    You'll see the following message after you sign up for the API:

    <Code code={signup_success} lang="shellscript" title="signup_success.sh" />

</Steps>

## Request a JSON Web Token

After you sign up for the API, you need to request a JSON Web Token (JWT) so you can access resources. Without a JWT, you will not be able to make `GET` or `POST` requests to the Brew Ha Ha API. 

To request a JWT:

<Steps>

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

    <Code code={request_jwt} lang="shellscript" title="request_jwt.sh" />

    You'll receive an access token and a refresh token after you send your credentials:

    <Code code={request_jwt_success} lang="shellscript" title="request_jwt_success.sh" />

</Steps>

### Request a refresh token 

The access token expires after 15 minutes. You can use the refresh token to request a new access token. 

To request a new access token:

<Steps>

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

    <Code code={request_refresh_jwt} lang="shellscript" title="request_refresh_jwt.sh" />

    You'll receive an access token and a refresh token after you send your credentials:

    <Code code={request_refresh_jwt_success} lang="shellscript" title="request_refresh_jwt_success.sh" />

    <Aside type="caution">
    Be sure to store your refresh token in a secure location. Your refresh token is valid for 24 hours. See [Authentication](./authentication) for more information.
    </Aside>

</Steps>

## Send a test ping to the server

Now that you have registered with the API and received a JWT, you can send a test ping to the server. This step verifies that you can send calls to the Brew Ha Ha API. 

To send a test ping:

<Steps>

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

    <Code code={test_ping} lang="shellscript" title="test_ping.sh" />

   You'll receive a successful message indicating that you successfully pinged the server:

   <Code code={test_ping_success} lang="shellscript" title="test_ping_success.sh" />

</Steps>

## Next steps

Congratulations! You've successfully registered with the API, received a JWT, and made your first call to the API. Next, consider reading some of the tutorials and guides to explore the Brew Ha Ha API functionality.
