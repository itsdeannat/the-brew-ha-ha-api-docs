The Brew Ha Ha API includes several endpoints that allow client applications to get a list of supported drinks and snacks. The API also returns JSON data and uses traditional HTTP methods to perform actions on data. Support for other programming languages is in development.

In this guide, you'll register with the API, get a JSON Web Token (JWT) so you can make calls to the API, and then send a test request to the server.

## Before you begin 

To begin using the API, you need to complete two steps:
