The Brew Ha Ha API includes an endpoint that allows client applications to submit new orders to the database. 

In this guide, you'll make a `POST` request to the `/orders/` endpoint to order a coffee. 

## Before you begin 

Before you make a `POST` request, ensure that you have an access token. For instructions on requesting an access token, see [Request a JSON Web Token](./api#request-a-json-web-token).

## Make a POST request

<Steps>

1. Open a terminal and run the following command:

    <Code code={post_order} lang="shellscript" title="post_order.sh" />

    The API returns a `201 CREATED` and returns the details of your order:

    <Code code={post_order_response} lang="shellscript" title="post_order_response.sh" />

</Steps>

You can use the data from the `POST` request in your application. For example, you could display the order date and list of products to your users. 

## What to do next

See [POST /orders/](/api-docs#tag/orders/operation/create_order) for a full list of request parameters and response schemas.
