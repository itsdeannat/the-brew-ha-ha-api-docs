The Brew Ha Ha API includes an endpoint that allows client applications to `GET` a product by ID.

In this guide, you'll make a `GET` request to the `/coffees` endpoint to get a specific coffee in the database.

## Before you begin 

Before you make a `GET` request, ensure that you have an access token. For instructions on requesting an access token, see [Request a JSON Web Token](./api#request-a-json-web-token).

## Make a GET request

<Steps>

1. Open a terminal and run the following command:

   <Code code={get_request_id} lang="shellscript" title="get_request_id.sh" />

    The API returns a `200 OK` and list of all coffees available for purchase:

    <Code code={get_request_id_response} lang="shellscript" title="get_request_id_response.sh" />

</Steps>

You can use the data from the `GET` request in your application. For example, you could display details about a specific product in your application.

## What to do next

See [GET /coffees/](/api-docs.html#tag/coffees/operation/list_coffees) for a full list of request parameters and response schemas.
